# Mask-Detection-System-with-Face-Recognition
Since the idea was to save a picture of the recognized face, hence before detection of mask, at the start of the videostream, each frame is being converted into images. Hence, when the code is run, the video output might show picture wise output. Rest of the code is included with comments for better understanding. Many other models can be used for detection like haar cascade, also the NN models can be anything other than SSDMNV2. To run the final code i.e. check project, type - 
python checkproject.py
